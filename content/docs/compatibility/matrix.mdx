## Known Issues

### SGLang Reasoning Token

SGLang's `reasoning_tokens` return format for DeepSeek-R1 and other reasoning models differs from OpenAI standard, which may cause missing statistics.

**Workaround**: Enable `normalize_reasoning_tokens` option in NexusGate configuration.

### MindIE Usage Statistics

Some MindIE versions return incomplete `usage` fields.

**Recommendation**: Upgrade to the latest MindIE version or enable token counting in NexusGate.
