## What is NexusGate?

NexusGate is an open-source AI gateway service designed to provide unified AI model invocation management capabilities. It serves as an intermediary layer connecting your applications with various AI model providers.

## Why NexusGate?

### 1. Unified Management of Multiple AI Services

If you use multiple AI providers simultaneously (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek), NexusGate helps you:

- Centrally manage all API Keys
- Unified monitoring of usage across services
- Simplify downstream tool configuration

### 2. Protect Your API Keys

Through NexusGate, you can:

- Create independent API Keys for different purposes
- Set usage limits for Keys
- Revoke compromised Keys at any time

### 3. Monitoring and Analytics

NexusGate provides detailed usage statistics:

- Token usage tracking
- Request success rate monitoring
- Reasoning Token statistics (supports o1 and other reasoning models)

## Core Features

### OpenAI Compatible API

NexusGate is fully compatible with the OpenAI API format, meaning:

- All tools supporting OpenAI API can be used directly
- No code changes required, just update the API endpoint
- Supports Chat Completions, Models, and other core endpoints

### Multi-Model Routing

Support for configuring multiple upstream model providers:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, etc.
- **Anthropic**: Claude 4 Opus/Sonnet
- **DeepSeek**: DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1
- **Alibaba Cloud**: Qwen series
- **Volcengine**: Doubao models
- **Local Deployment**: vLLM, SGLang, TGI, etc.

### Usage Tracking

Precise statistics for each request's resource consumption:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 100,
    "completion_tokens": 50,
    "total_tokens": 150,
    "reasoning_tokens": 30
  }
}
```
